# AIME Bot

# Usage
Use this bot to fetch past American Invitational Mathematics Exam problems from 2022 to practice for the exam!

# How to use
To select a specific problem, you must type in its problem id. The id is formed by:

+ Getting the year of release(i.e 2022)
+ Getting the version of the test(AIME I/II)
+ Getting the problem number(i.e #13)

If one wants to find the 2022 AIME II Problem 7, then the id will simply be 202227. 2022 is the year of release, 2 is the version, and 7 is the problem number.

If one wants a random problem, simply type in `!random` and the bot will spew a randomly picked problem.

If one wants to check/find the answer to their problem, simply type in `!answer [problem id] [answer]`(with spaces) and the bot will reply by responding whether it is incorrect or correct.

Using the `!test` command generates a random AIME test that is based off other past AIME problems.

Using the `!info` command will pull up your statistics, which include problems summoned/attempted/correct/incorrect/percentage correct and test generated.

Please note for 2022 AIME II Problem #8, only 080 will be accepted as the correct answer.
